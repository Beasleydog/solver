# Pyramid Solver

I implemented two solvers:

1. A Node.js script to solve the pyramids
2. A simple React app to visualize the solutions

## Running the Node.js Script

To run the Node.js script:

1. Open a terminal in the project root directory.
2. Run the following command:

   ```
   node index.js
   ```

This script will:

- Read the pyramid data from `pyramid_sample_input.txt`
- Find the path!
- Write the result to `pyramid_sample_output.txt`

## Running the React App

To run the React app, follow these steps:

1. Run the following commands:

   ```
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

2. Upload `pyramid_sample_input.txt` to the UI

Thank you!
